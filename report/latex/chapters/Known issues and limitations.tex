For the borrower is hard to get a fast loan, since funds are to be retrieved from many lenders who buy WonkaBars. Moreover lenders are uncertain about the future of the lottery, because there are three different endings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item first one, if the borrower repays the loan, lenders will be awarded with ChocoChips and refunded of their investment;
    \item second, if the borrower doesn't repay the loan and the WonkaBar does not have the golden ticket, the lender will only be awarded with ChocoChips;
    \item but if the the WonkaBar has the golden ticket (third case), the lender will be awarded with ChocoChips and the NFT of the borrower.
\end{itemize}
